# Deep-Learning-Techniques-To-Predict-Number-Of-Objects-In-Image-

Developed generic neural network for multi-class classification to predict number of objects in 16*16 RGBA image

Applied soft-max activation at output layer of 5 neurons and utilized Cross Entropy Loss for back-propagation

Explored F1-score over different hidden layer depths using Mini batch stochastic gradient descent with adaptive learning rate depending on epoch over sigmoid and Relu activation and get maximum accuracy of 66%
